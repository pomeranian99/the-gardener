The Pixel Gardener
==================

I enjoy making P5 sketches that use chunky pixellated grids.

I was playing around with a function that generated random flowers by blending seven possible interior patterns with four possible exterior patterns (and a few dozen colors), so something like 26,000 possible flowers ...

... and got the idea to create a sketch where a little pixel gardener wanders the screen, planting flowers while a chill loop plays.

Let it run for 10 minutes or so and the gardens get pretty trippy.

This is software that exists for essentially _no purpose_, lol. 

A ... screensaver, of sorts?
