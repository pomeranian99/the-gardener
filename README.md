The Pixel Gardener
==================

### Instructions

Leave it open in separate browser window ...

... and the little pixel -- the "gardener" -- will wander slowly and randomly around the screen ...

... and plant flowers. It plays a little chill loop of music.

If you leave it running for 15 minutes the gardens get quite complicated and pretty!

### Can I run it in the background?

Sure! 

Just make sure you can see at least _a bit_ of the app's screen peeking from behind your active browser window. 

Otherwise the app goes to sleep for some reason; you'll hear the music, but the planting is suspended.


### Why?

Lol, no reason. This is software that exists for essentially _no purpose_.

A ... distant relative screensaver? I guess?

I got bored on vacation and decided to make it.
