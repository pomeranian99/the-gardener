The Pixel Gardener
==================

### Instructions

Leave it open in separate browser window ...

... and the little pixel -- the "gardener" -- will wander slowly and randomly around the screen ...

... and plant flowers. It plays a little chill loop of music.

If you leave it running for 15 minutes the gardens get quite complicated and pretty!

### Can I run it in the background?

Sure! Just make sure you can see at least a bit of the screen in behind your active browser window. Otherwise the app goes to sleep; you'll hear the music but the planting is suspended for some reason.


### Why?

Lol, no reason. This is software that exists for essentially _no purpose_.

A ... screensaver, of sorts?
